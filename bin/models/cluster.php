/**
 * A cluster is the link between a bucket and a bunch of servers. Every cluster 
 * must contain a master and at least one slave before it can be used to  handle
 * a bucket.
 * 
 * When the leader receives requests for the data inside a bucket connected to a 
 * cluster, the leader will point the application trying to write / read data to 
 * the appropriate master which will interface with the client for write operations
 * and redirect them to the appropriate slave if they are trying to read.
 * 
 * This generates barely no overhead, since the application requesting the file 
 * will generally provide it's client with a link to the resource they're trying
 * to fetch from cloudy, and therefore also converting it into a somewhat competent
 * CDN.
